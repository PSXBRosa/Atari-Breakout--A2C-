# [Atari Breakout][A2C]

The current repository was the fruit of an experiment that I decided to upload to my github. This model was not trained for a sufficient amount of time and my current setup (sadly) doesn't have the computational power to keep it running, however, the results - that can be seen bellow - are still interesting and I'm satisfied with them. Due to the initial nature of this project, the code shown here isn't properly commented, but I still hope it can be useful to someone one day.

### To train the model, run the "treino.py" file inside the repository folder
### To test the model, run the "teste.py" file inside the repository folder
